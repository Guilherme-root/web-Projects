                <p>In every generation, there are a few visionary and profound masters who hold high the lamp of the
                    Dharma to illuminate the world. Like the Dalai Lama and Thich Nhat Hanh, Ven. S.N. Goenka was one of
                    the great world masters of our time. [He] was an inspiration and teacher for Joseph Goldstein and
                    Sharon Salzberg, Ram Dass, Daniel Goleman, and many other western spiritual leaders. </p>
